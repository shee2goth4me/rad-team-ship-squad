## About Us

The Ship-Every-Friday Squad is more than just a group of developers. We believe in the power of collaboration and innovation. Our mission is to ship projects that can reach millions of users each week. We are looking for MERN and Python developers who see AI tools as teammates rather than just software.

## How to Join

Joining our squad is simple. You can apply by submitting a Pull Request (PR). Our bot will analyze your GitHub profile and score you based on two main criteria:

- **GenAI Usage (50%)**: How effectively you use Generative AI tools in your projects.
- **Open Source Contributions (30%)**: Your contributions to open-source projects.

This scoring system helps us identify developers who align with our values and vision.

## Requirements

To be a part of our team, you should meet the following requirements:

- Proficiency in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
- Strong knowledge of **Python**.
- Familiarity with **AI tools** and their integration into development workflows.
- A passion for **open source** and collaboration.
